# Possibilities

Okay, so this is a small project to practice using some developer tools before
burning the house down on some larger project. 

The iChing is the old chinese text known as the book of changes. In essence, it
is a philosophical system, where a philosopher (that's anyone who reads the
book, by the way) reflects upon a specific question about a set of
circumstances of which they are currently aware. 

Such a reflection is created by using a chance based systemm, traditionally
either coin tosses or stick throws to divine a path to a specific part of the
text. 

# Divine a what? 

Okay, so woowoo aside, the text of the iChing consists of 64 **hexagrams**. Each
hexagram consists of two **trigrams** and each trigram consists of three
**lines**. The lines can be **broken** or **unbroken**, **changing** or
**unchanging**.

The reader builds a hexagram by tossing three coins to generate numerical
values 

    Heads (H) is worth 3
    Tails (T) is worth 2
   
it follows that:    
 
    HHH = 9
    lineHHH = "-o-"
    
    HHT = 8 
    lineHHT = "- -"
    
    HTT = 7  
    lineHTT = "---"

    TTT = 6
    lineTTT = "-x-"


As there are already in existence many wonderful translations of this text,
this program is not initially geared at their reproduction them, instead the
idea is to use it to generate a hexagram for the reader. 



# Initial commit 

The inital commit is a single file containing a hexagram class, which can be
instantiated with a question in an interactive session. The reading is
generated by calling a member function. Generally, something like 

```python

myQuestion = Hexagram()
myQuestion.printReading()

```

will return a very simple graphical representation (in chars) to the console.
